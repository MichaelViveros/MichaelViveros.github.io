## Intro
Hi, I'm Michael Viveros. I am a passionate programmer, incredibly inconsistent golfer and sarcastically subtle joker.

## Music
I have been playing the trumpet for over 8 years. As a member of the McMaster Marching Band, I played in many parades including the Toronto Santa Clause Parade and the Montreal St. Patrick's Day Parade.

## Volunteer

### Hamilton Code Club
I taught programming to a class of 20 middle-school kids as part of the [Hamilton Code Club](http://www.hamiltoncodeclub.com/). The language they learned was Scratch, a free visual programming language.

### D.R.E.A.M.S
Also, I participated in 3 humanitarian trips to the Dominican Republic through D.R.E.A.M.S - Dominican Republic Education and Medical Support. I got to experience life in a 3rd World country and really enjoyed talking and laughing with the local Dominicanos.
